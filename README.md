# GS-reconstruction
Samples of 3D reconstruction using Gaussian splatting

## Features

The Google colab notebook is provided with the code to train gaussians using reconstructed model. The training doesn't require 24Gb videocard, but could be implemented using 16Gb T4 in Google Colab or even localy with 8Gb videocard.

## Example

Gaussian splatting reconstruction of a parrot.
