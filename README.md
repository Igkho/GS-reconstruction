# GS-reconstruction
Samples of 3D reconstruction using Gaussian splatting

## Features

The Google colab notebook is provided with the code to train gaussians using a reconstructed model. The training doesn't require a 24Gb video card, but could be implemented using 16Gb T4 in Google Colab or even locally with 8Gb video card.

## Example

Gaussian splatting reconstruction of a parrot.
